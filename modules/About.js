    return <p>Howdy,my name is Ernesto and I am currently in the sixth week
      of The Iron Yard cohort and I am BLOWN away with all the information that I have learned so far.
      I have to tell you that it was a bit overwhelming for me in the beginning
      since I had slim to none knowledge about computers and let alone coding but
      my instructor has been VERY,VERY patient with me which I appreciate greatly.
      It seems like it was only last week when I was learning about CSS and HTML
      now we are currently learning React for javascript. I cannot wait to see
      how much I will have learned in the next six weeks and to see where my skiil
      set is when I complete the course and begin my career!
    </p>
